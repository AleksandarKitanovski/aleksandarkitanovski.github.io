			Data Scientist. I love to learn and apply my knowledge, I like working in collaborative
			environments and I am a great team player. The focus of my studies was mostly Data Science and
			Applied Mathematics, while my work experience includes web development at Ludotech, chat-bot
			development and data analysis at GrabIT, and developing systems for time series anomaly
			detection at Nebb (now called Init). During my studies at FCSE I also published three research
			papers, two of them at the CiiT Conference in Macedonia, and one at the MIPRO Convention in
			Croatia.</p></article> <article class="mt-10"><h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl text-orange-600 mb-2">Hobbies</h1> <p class="text-justify text-lg lg:text-xl">I have several hobbies that keep life exciting and fulfilling. I&#39;m an avid gamer, immersing

			to play ever since I was a child, I&#39;m not very good at it, but the game is very dear to me.
			Programming is both a profession and a passion, ever since I wrote my first &quot;Hello, world!&quot;
			more than 10 years ago. And my most favorite things to do are cooking and baking - I love
			trying out new recipes and making food for myself and my loved ones.</p></article>`;return{c(){e=m("div"),e.innerHTML=n,this.h()},l(t){e=d(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),c(e)!=="svelte-1yavqpw"&&(e.innerHTML=n),this.h()},h(){g(e,"class","mt-2 mb-16 lg:my-10 mx-4 md:mx-32 lg:mx-80")},m(t,i){h(t,e,i)},p:a,i:a,o:a,d(t){t&&p(e)}}}class u extends l{constructor(e){super(),r(this,e,null,v,o,{})}}export{u as component};
