		and compare their effectiveness in fake news detection. Both models were trained on a labelled
		dataset of news articles and evaluated on two datasets, comparing their performance in terms of
		accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. The results of the experiments showed that both models
		perform well, with RoBERTa achieving slightly better results overall. This project resulted in a
		paper that was published at the MIPRO Convention in Croatia.`;return{c(){t=y("p"),t.textContent=a,this.h()},l(e){t=b(e,"P",{slot:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),C(t)!=="svelte-1jgjgz5"&&(t.textContent=a),this.h()},h(){$(t,"slot","desc")},m(e,r){R(e,t,r)},p:w,d(e){e&&_(t)}}}function M(i){let t,a,e,r,l,o,u;return a=new g({props:{title:"Programming Languages",data:[["Python",1]]}}),r=new g({props:{title:"Frameworks & Libraries",data:[["Transformers",4],["Scikit-learn",3],["Pandas",2],["Seaborn",1],["Numpy",1]]}}),o=new g({props:{title:"Other software",data:[["Google Colab",2],["LaTeX",1]]}}),{c(){t=y("div"),c(a.$$.fragment),e=k(),c(r.$$.fragment),l=k(),c(o.$$.fragment),this.h()},l(n){t=b(n,"DIV",{slot:!0,class:!0});var s=D(t);m(a.$$.fragment,s),e=v(s),m(r.$$.fragment,s),l=v(s),m(o.$$.fragment,s),s.forEach(_),this.h()},h(){$(t,"slot","tech"),$(t,"class","flex flex-col mt-3 mb-6 justify-evenly space-y-8 lg:space-y-0 lg:flex-row lg:space-x-4")},m(n,s){R(n,t,s),f(a,t,null),x(t,e),f(r,t,null),x(t,l),f(o,t,null),u=!0},p:w,i(n){u||(p(a.$$.fragment,n),p(r.$$.fragment,n),p(o.$$.fragment,n),u=!0)},o(n){d(a.$$.fragment,n),d(r.$$.fragment,n),d(o.$$.fragment,n),u=!1},d(n){n&&_(t),h(a),h(r),h(o)}}}function F(i){let t,a;return t=new B({props:{slot:"skills",dataPoints:{labels:["Text Processing","Data Analysis","Transformer Models","Model Selection","Imbalanced Data","Fake News"],data:[8,7,10,9,7,3]}}}),{c(){c(t.$$.fragment)},l(e){m(t.$$.fragment,e)},m(e,r){f(t,e,r),a=!0},p:w,i(e){a||(p(t.$$.fragment,e),a=!0)},o(e){d(t.$$.fragment,e),a=!1},d(e){h(t,e)}}}function S(i){let t,a;return t=new I({props:{title:"DistilBERT and RoBERTa Models for Identification of Fake News",company:"FINKI",duration:"2 months",href:"https://www.finki.ukim.mk/",paper:"https://repository.ukim.mk/bitstream/20.500.12188/28593/1/MIPRO2023_Mirceva_fake_news.pdf",$$slots:{skills:[F],tech:[M],desc:[E]},$$scope:{ctx:i}}}),{c(){c(t.$$.fragment)},l(e){m(t.$$.fragment,e)},m(e,r){f(t,e,r),a=!0},p(e,[r]){const l={};r&1&&(l.$$scope={dirty:r,ctx:e}),t.$set(l)},i(e){a||(p(t.$$.fragment,e),a=!0)},o(e){d(t.$$.fragment,e),a=!1},d(e){h(t,e)}}}class z extends P{constructor(t){super(),j(this,t,null,S,T,{})}}export{z as component};
