			environments and I am a great team player. The focus of my studies was mostly Data Science and
			Applied Mathematics, while my work experience includes web development at Ludotech, chat-bot
			development and data analysis at GrabIT, and developing systems for time series anomaly

		<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl text-orange-600 mb-2">Hobbies</h1>
		<p class="text-justify text-lg lg:text-xl">
			I have several hobbies that keep life exciting and fulfilling. I'm an avid gamer, immersing
			myself in virtual worlds and challenging adventures. I also love reading, which offers an
			escape into captivating narratives and thought-provoking ideas. Chess is something I've loved
			to play ever since I was a child, I'm not very good at it, but the game is very dear to me.
			Programming is both a profession and a passion, ever since I wrote my first "Hello, world!"
			more than 10 years ago. And my most favorite things to do are cooking and baking - I love
			trying out new recipes and making food for myself and my loved ones.
