		<p class="text-justify text-lg lg:text-xl">
			I have a bachelors degree in Computer Science from FINKI, and 2 years work experience as a
			Data Scientist. I love to learn and apply my knowledge, I like working in collaborative
			environments and I am a great team player. The focus of my studies was mostly Data Science and
			Applied Mathematics, while my work experience includes web development at Ludotech, chat-bot
			development and data analysis (at GrabIT) and developing systems for time series anomaly
			detection (at Nebb). During my studies at FCSE I also published three research papers, two of
			them at the CiiT Conference in Macedonia, and one at the MIPRO Convention in Croatia.

		<h1 class="text-4xl lg:text-5xl text-orange-600 mb-2">Hobbies</h1>
		<p class="text-justify text-lg lg:text-xl">
			I have several hobbies that keep life exciting and fulfilling. I'm an avid gamer, immersing
			myself in virtual worlds and challenging adventures. I also love reading, which offers an
			escape into captivating narratives and thought-provoking ideas. Chess is something I've loved
			to play ever since I was a child, I'm not very good at it, but the game is very dear to me.
			Programming is both a profession and a passion, ever since I wrote my first "Hello, world!"
			more than 10 years ago.
