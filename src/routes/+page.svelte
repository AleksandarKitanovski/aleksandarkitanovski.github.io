	<ListItem title="Sep, 1999 - Landed on Earth">
		Right before Krypton was destroyed, my parents loaded me up in an escape pod and sent me to
		Earth, along with my cousin Kal-El (you might know him as Clark Kent). While Clark decided to be
		Superman, I decided to be a super programmer.
	</ListItem>
	<ListItem title="Sep, 2005 - Started Elementary School">
		Playing Super Mario among other games on a NES was my first introduction to gaming, and what
		originally drew me towards programming as a career. This was also around the time I got my first
		computer, and with more games came more curiosity - why not learn how to make them myself one
		day?
	</ListItem>
	<ListItem title="Sep, 2010 - Started Middle School">
		During this time I got access to the internet, and started figuring out how to write batch
		scripts on Windows XP, after a while I discovered C++ and started teaching myself programming. I
		was having more fun than I could imagine.
